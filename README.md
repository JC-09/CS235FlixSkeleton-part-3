* Right click the CS235FlixSkeleton-part-2-master folder and select "Open Folder as PyCharm Community Edition Project" **OR** simply launch PyCharm and select this folder via the open folder option.

You will see a link, either http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or  http://localhost:5000/ appear in the terminal. Single click this link will launch CS235 Flix in your default browser.


# Important Note to Markers
The home page will take a short while to load (10 seconds for me) due to it is extracting movie cover images from an external API, IMDb Py API. This is normal as it takes time for the API to return data.
This same issue will occur when doing an integration testing for the home route.

All other functions of the Web Application have minimal loading time.

If one would like to disable to the API, please go to <code>CS235FlixSkeleton-part-2/CS235Flix/home/home.py</code> and **comment out line 23 and line 24.**
This will stop the Web app from using the IMDb API and the long loading problem will disappear.

My apology to any inconvenience this may cause and I highly appreciate your understanding.
